            <p>There was no good reason to be on campus that late spring day. I ran into the Peruvian and got it from him there might be good money working as a fisherman in Alaska. He had this on authority from the Estonian, who, in retrospect, was a bit flakey. Besides, it was 1995&mdash;ten years before <em>Deadliest Catch</em>&mdash;so Stone was really our only source for information.</p>
            <p>We agreed to meet for coffee a few days later and Peru told me what he knew about the job. It sounded plausible, and with some encouragement from Stone, I bought a one-way ticket to King Salmon, AK.</p>
            <p>Departure day came quickly and Stone had visa problems, so Peru and I rode the friendly skies through SEA-TAC to Anchorage. From there we boarded a much smaller aircraft, front-end and mid-section stuffed to the gills with cargo.</p>
            <p>The baggage claim was four pallets hemmed in by a low plywood wall. We hoisted our bags in the light drizzle and accepted a ride from a cannery worker.</p>
            <p>She filled us in on how things worked. Everything Stone had told us was wrong. Lying to a captain, telling him you had experience as a fisherman would, at best, be transparent and never get you a job. At worst, the fiction would be discovered out on the water, where the trust of your shipmates was necessary for survival. She dropped us at Tent City, a rough campground on the eastern edge of Naknek.</p>
            <p>Now Naknek and King Salmon are connected by a highway. It runs about 13 miles long, and if you steal a car in Naknek, you can drive to King Salmon, make a u-turn and come back again. There is no way out other than by boat or by plane. This isolation has a curious effect on people, and sudden, random violence was not uncommon. More on this later.</p>
            <p>It's been long enough that I no longer remember how many tents were pitched out there on the tundra. 30? 70? However many it was, the group hanging out at the shelter round the picnic tables were a rough lot. The conversation had maybe three themes:
                <ul>
                    <li>Been fishing for five years, got here six weeks ago, and still haven't found a job</li>
                    <li>Blew ten grand on crack cocaine and hookers</li>
                    <li>I'd rather starve than do anything but fishing</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Bear in mind that I had maybe $30 to my name, and in my na&iuml;vet&eacute;, I imagined the fishing job would come to me almost instantaneously, meeting my basic needs. The reality sinking in now was that I was rapidly on track to a dire poverty with no real way out.</p>
            <p><em>I'd rather starve than do anything but fishing</em></p>
            <p>As I heard the variations on that particular theme, I began to formulate a plan. How was a greenhorn like me supposed to get a fishing job when people with five years of experience couldn't get hired?</p>
            <h2>My job description: anything but fishing.</h2>
