    <p>There was no good reason to be on campus that late spring day. I ran into the Peruvian and got it from him there might be good money working as a fisherman in Alaska. He had this on authority from the Estonian, who, in retrospect, was a bit flakey.</p>
    <p>We agreed to meet for coffee a few days later and Peru told me what he knew about the job. It sounded plausible, and with some encouragement from Stone, I bought a one-way ticket to King Salmon, AK.</p>
    <p>Departure day came quickly and Stone had visa problems, so Peru and I rode the friendly skies through SEA-TAC to Anchorage. From there we boarded a much smaller aircraft, front-end and mid-section stuffed to the gills with cargo.</p>
    <p>The baggage claim was four pallets hemmed in by a low plywood wall. We hoisted our bags in the light drizzle and accepted a ride from a cannery worker.
    </p>
    <p>She filled us in on how things worked. Everything Stone had told us was wrong. Lying to a captain, telling him you had experience as a fisherman would, at best, be transparent and never get you a job. At worst, the fiction would be discovered out on the water, where the trust of your shipmates was necessary for survival. She dropped us at Tent City, a rough campground on the eastern edge of Naknek.</p>
    <p>Now Naknek and King Salmon are connected by a highway. It runs about 13 miles long, and if you steal a car in Naknek, you can drive to King Salmon, make a u-turn and come back again. There is no way out other than by boat or by plane. This isolation has a curious effect on people, and sudden, random violence was not uncommon. More on this later.</p>
    <p>It's been long enough that I no longer remember how many tents were pitched out there on the tundra. 30? 70? However many it was, the group hanging out at the shelter round the picnic tables were there. The conversation had maybe three themes:
        <ul>
            <li>"Been fishing for five years, got here six weeks ago, and still haven't found a job..."</li>
            <li>"Blew ten grand on crack cocaine and hookers"</li>
            <li>"I'd rather starve than do any other job besides fish"</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
