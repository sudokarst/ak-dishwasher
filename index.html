    <p>There was no good reason to be on campus that late spring day. I ran into the Peruvian and got it from him there might be good money working as a fisherman in Alaska. He had this on authority from the Estonian, who, in retrospect, was a bit flakey.</p>
    <p>We agreed to meet for coffee a few days later and Peru told me what he knew about the job. It sounded plausible, and with some encouragement from Stone, I bought a one-way ticket to King Salmon, AK.</p>
    <p>Departure day came quickly and Stone had visa problems, so Peru and I rode the friendly skies through SEA-TAC to Anchorage. From there we boarded a much smaller aircraft, front-end and mid-section stuffed to the gills with cargo.</p>
    <p>The baggage claim was four pallets hemmed in by a low plywood wall. We hoisted our bags in the light drizzle and accepted a ride from a cannery worker.

    <p>Everything Stone had told us was wrong. </p>
